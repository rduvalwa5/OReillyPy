"""Callable Example 
    Function and Method Callls
    The __call__() method is interestingâ€”its name implies that it has something to do with function calling, and this is correct. 
    The interpreter calls any callable object by making use of its __call__() method. You can actually call this method directly if you want to; it's exactly 
    the same as calling the function directly.
