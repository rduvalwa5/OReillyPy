Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 4, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Make a FileHandling_Homework project and assign it to your Python2_Homework working set. In that project, write a module 
containing a function to examine the contents of the current working directory and print out a count of how many files have each 
extension (".txt", ".doc", etc.)

Write a separate module to verify by testing that the function gives correct results.
