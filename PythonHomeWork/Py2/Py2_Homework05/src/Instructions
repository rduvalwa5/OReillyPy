Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 5, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Write a function (not a class) that takes two arguments, a string player name 
and an integer score, and keeps a "high score" table in a Python shelve. If the integer argument is higher 
than the given player's current high score (or if the player has no recorded high score), log the value as this 
player's new high score. The function should return the player's current high score. Remember, a function is not 
the same thing as a class and it's a function that's needed.
