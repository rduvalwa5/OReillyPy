Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 2, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Make a UnitTesting_Homework project and assign it to the Python2_Homework working set. In this project, write a unittest 
test program for the following function.
 (The test program makes unittest.TestCase assertions about the results of calling the function with known arguments.)

def title(s):
    "How close is this function to str.title()?"
    return s[0].upper()+s[1:]Test your results for a given string s by comparing them with s.title().

 Because this is purely an exercise it's OK to put your test code in the same file as the function and just hand in a single file.
 Your file should be an importable module.

 You should be able to find an example that shows title(s) and s.title() diverge (have different output).

 Bonus marks for fixing the error in the function above (i.e. making it behave more like the native method). 

How long did it take you to complete this project?What's this?
