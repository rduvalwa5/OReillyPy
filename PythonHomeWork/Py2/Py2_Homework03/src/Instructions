Python 2: Getting More Out of Python
 Lesson 3, Project 1

Here are your instructions:

Make a TestDrivenDevelopment_Homework project and assign it to the Python2_Homework working set.
 Copy the setupDemo.py file from the TestDrivenDevelopment/src folder to the TestDrivenDevelopment_Homework/src folder.

 Modify it so that:
¥ The test_1() method includes code to verify that the test directory contains only the files created by the for loop. 
Hint: You might create a set containing the list of three filenames, and then create a set from the os.listdir() method.
¥A test_3() method creates a binary file that contains exactly a million bytes, closes it and then uses os.stat to verify
 that the file on disk is of the correct length (with os.stat, statinfo.st_size returns the size in bytes).
